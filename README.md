This module provides functionality for handling file uploads via `@Upload` annotations and
file storage/retrieval using Mongo DB's GridFS.

It also provides image management functionality using GraphicsMagick under the covers.  This 
allows you to retrieve images and provide different sizes, transformations, etc. when
serving up them up.
